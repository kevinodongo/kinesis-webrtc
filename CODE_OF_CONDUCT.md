## How can I contribute?
If you have an awesome new feature that you want to implement or you found a bug that you would like to fix, here are some instructions to guide you through the process:

1. Create an issue to explain and discuss the details
2. Fork the repo
3. Clone the repo and set it up (check out the manual installation section in README.md)

## Implement the necessary changes
1. Create tests to keep the code coverage high
2. Send a pull request

## Guidelines
1. Git commit messages
2. Limit the subject line to 72 characters
3. Capitalize the first letter of the subject line
4. Use the present tense ("Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
5. Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
6. Reference issues and pull requests in the body
7. Coding style guide

We are using ESLint to ensure a consistent code style in the project, based on Airbnb's JS style guide.

Some other ESLint plugins are also being used, such as the Prettier and Jest plugins.

Please make sure that the code you are pushing conforms to the style guides mentioned above.
